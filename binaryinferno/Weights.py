# Deprecated weighting for consideration in Conflict Resolution Phase
# Useful for Future Work.
# If we wanted to scale the strength of a hypothesis in the conflict resolution phase
# based on the detector, or semantic type, this would allow us to do so.
# For our evaluation however we did not scale anything. 
# Scaling would only come into play when you have many inferred fields overlapping and 
# need to decide what should take precedence. For example a serialization pattern over a float.
